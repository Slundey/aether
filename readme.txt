Simple rougelike game where your objective is to progress down a never dugeon comprised of seemingly endless levels.
After each level the player is given the option to return to the surface and upgrade their weaponry and armour if they
choose to do so.
The game depends on the Windows API for the graphics so it's not able to run on any other platforms :/
Tested with:
- gcc version 8.2.0 (MinGW.org GCC-8.2.0-5)
- ...
To compile it run make.
