Simple rougelike game where your objective is to progress down a never dugeon comprised of seemingly endless levels.
After each level the player is given the option to return to the surface and upgrade their weaponry and armour if
they choose to do so. After this they can return to the depths of the dungeon and continue their exploration.
The game depends on the Windows API for the graphics so it's not able to run on any other platform :/
Tested with:
- gcc version 8.2.0 (MinGW.org GCC-8.2.0-5)
- ...
To compile it run make.
